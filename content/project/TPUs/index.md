## Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are deep-learning specialized hardware accelerators available through Kaggle and Google Colab.

### Getting Started Notebooks

**Getting Started: TPUs + Cassava Leaf Disease** is a [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/getting-started-tpus-cassava-leaf-disease) built for anyone interested in creating a baseline model using Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and begin making submissions to the [Cassava Leaf Disease Classification competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-leaf-disease-classification). If you've taken the [Kaggle Intro to Deep Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-deep-learning) and//or the [Kaggle Computer Vision course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/computer-vision) you'll find this notebook to be a good starting place to bridge what you've learned in our micro-courses and applying that knowledge to get started in a competition.

**Getting Started: Rainforest EDA with TFRecords** is a [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/getting-started-rainforest-eda-with-tfrecords) that walks through an introductory-level exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the [TensorFlow Simple audio recognition: Recognizing keywords tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/audio/simple_audio#top_of_page) and applying those learnings to the TFRecords that are available in the [Rainforest Connection Species Audio Detection competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rfcx-species-audio-detection).
