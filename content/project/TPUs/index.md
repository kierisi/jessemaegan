excerpt: A collection of Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) content that I created while at Kaggle. Tensor Processing Units are hardware accelerators developed by Google, and are specialized for deep learning tasks. While they're designed to be compatible with TensorFlow, there have been a growing number of excellent resources dedicated to using TPUs with PyTorch.

## Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are deep-learning specialized hardware accelerators available through Kaggle and Google Colab.

### Getting Started Notebooks

**Getting Started: TPUs + Cassava Leaf Disease** is a [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/getting-started-tpus-cassava-leaf-disease) built for anyone interested in creating a baseline model using Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and begin making submissions to the [Cassava Leaf Disease Classification competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-leaf-disease-classification). If you've taken the [Kaggle Intro to Deep Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-deep-learning) and//or the [Kaggle Computer Vision course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/computer-vision) you'll find this notebook to be a good starting place to bridge what you've learned in our micro-courses and applying that knowledge to get started in a competition.

**Getting Started: Rainforest EDA with TFRecords** is a [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/getting-started-rainforest-eda-with-tfrecords) that walks through an introductory-level exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the [TensorFlow Simple audio recognition: Recognizing keywords tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/audio/simple_audio#top_of_page) and applying those learnings to the TFRecords that are available in the [Rainforest Connection Species Audio Detection competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rfcx-species-audio-detection).
