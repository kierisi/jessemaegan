<h1>We’re going on a learning adventure!</h1>
<p>This summer we’d like to challenge you to participate in the “Summer of Data Science” Twitter initiative hosted by none other than <a href="https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci">Data Science Renee</a>! While the Summer of Data Science (SoDS) supports all languages and endeavors related to becoming a (better) data scientist, we wanted to host a space within our <a href="https://www.jessemaegan.com/post/r4ds-the-next-iteration/"><em>R4DS Online Learning Community</em></a> for our community members to ask questions, provide support, and in general discuss what we’re learning within our chosen text!</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p><strong>Could you please explain what SoDS18 <em>is</em>?</strong></p>
<p>The Summer of Data Science is an initiative started by <a href="https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci">Data Science Renee</a> that focuses on making a <a href="https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2017/05/29/summer-of-data-science-2017/">commitment to learn something this summer to enhance your data science skills, and to share what you learned.</a></p>
<p><strong>How do I sign up for the online learning community?</strong></p>
<p>You can read more about the overall community as well as sign up for our Slack group <a href="https://www.jessemaegan.com/post/r4ds-the-next-iteration/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that you <strong><em>do not</em></strong> have to be a part of our online learning community in order to participate in #SoDS18! #SoDS18 exists as a creation of <a href="https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSc">Data Science Renee</a>, while our online learning community can choose to participate within our Slack channel <em>as well as</em> on the Twitter #SoDS18 campaign.</p>
<p><strong>How do I choose a book?</strong></p>
<p>This will vary by individual preference, but if you’re looking for a “just right” text, skim the first few chapters of a text. If everything looks pretty familiar, great! Now go to the last few chapters and skim. If everything looks like something you’ve never seen or heard before, and <em>definitely</em> has information that you couldn’t explain to someone else, then this book is probably “just right” for you.</p>
<p><strong>I want to read a book not listed - will there be a channel for me in the Slack group?</strong></p>
<p>No, however you are still encouraged to work through a book or course and share what you’ve learned on Twitter by using the #SoDS18 hashtag.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you only list books? There are so many other ways to learn R and data science!</strong></p>
<p>There are hundreds, if not thousands, of resources that you can use to learn R and data science. The books were chosen in order to provide the greatest accessibility possible by removing any financial barriers, while staying firmly within the <code>tidyverse</code> approach to programming in R.</p>
<p><strong>I’m only joining this group for the SoDS event. Do I have to follow your <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md">Code of Conduct?</a></strong></p>
<p>Yes, <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md">our Code of Conduct</a> is non-negotiable.</p>
<p><strong>I want to learn Python for Data Science - will there be a channel for me in the Slack group?</strong></p>
<p>No, but consider reaching out to the Python for Data Science group!</p>
