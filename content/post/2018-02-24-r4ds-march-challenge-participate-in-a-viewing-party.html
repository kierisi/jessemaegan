<p>We’re so close to March, which for many of you involves a lot of college basketball.</p>

</div>
<p>But there’s <em>another</em> exciting challenge happening, once which <em>also</em> happens to involve your participation: R4DS is hosting its first series of community member talks!</p>
<hr />
<div id="the-challenge-participate" class="section level2">
<h2>The Challenge: Participate!</h2>
<p>Four of our community members have graciously stepped up to record a 20-30 minute talk on an R4DS-related topic, and they will be developing these over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>The talks will be pre-recorded and published to YouTube in order to keep our technology overhead as low as possible, and to give our presenters the opportunity to participate in the viewing party!</p>
<p>What is a viewing party, you ask? Great question! We’ll announce a scheduled viewing party date and time, and when that date and time arrives, we’ll share the link to the presentation. Everyone is encouraged to watch the video at that time, and to join the community in the <strong>#general</strong> channel on Slack. In the <strong>#general</strong> channel the presenter will be available to answer questions and provide clarification, while community members can share their support, encouragement, and ask questions!</p>

<div id="what-if-i-cant-make-it-to-a-viewing-party" class="section level3">
<h3>What if I can’t make it to a viewing party?</h3>
<p>Not to worry - we’ve got you covered! The link will be available in the <strong>#general</strong> channel, and you’ll be able to watch it at your leisure. We’ll also be posting the videos to our <em>(soon to be created)</em> YouTube channel.</p>

<div id="i-would-love-to-create-a-talk---is-it-too-late" class="section level3">
<h3>I would love to create a talk - is it too late?</h3>
<p>Absolutely not! We’d love to have <strong><em>all</em></strong> of our community members provide a talk, and want to encourage everyone to get involved. If you’re interested in presenting, please reach out to Jesse M in Slack and she’ll help you get scheduled.</p>

<h3>What is this Slack group, and how can I get involved?</h3>
<p>Excellent question! We have an online learning community of over 1,000 learners and mentors who collaborate on working (asynchronously) through the <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a> text. You can read more about the group structure and philosophy, as well as sign up, <a href="https://www.jessemaegan.com/post/r4ds-the-next-iteration/">here</a>.</p>

<h3>I don’t want to join the group, but I <em>do</em> want to see the talks</h3>
<p>We’ll be making the talks public after the viewing party, at which point you’ll be able to access them.</p>
