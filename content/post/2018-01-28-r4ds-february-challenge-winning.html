<p>It’s February–which most people associate with Valentine’s Day, and that’s fine–but for all of us in the <a href="https://www.jessemaegan.com/post/r4ds-the-next-iteration/">R4DS Online Learning Community</a>, we’re going to focus on winning!</p>
<hr />
<div id="the-challenge-share-your-wins" class="section level2">
<h2>The challenge: share your wins</h2>
<p>The challenge is short and sweet this month, and the same for both learners and mentors:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Once a week for the month of February, post a “win” that you’ve had in our #wins channel on Slack</li>
<li>Engage with community members in the channel–emoji responses or starting a conversation by replying to someone’s win are both great ways to do this!</li>
</ol>

<h2>What counts as a win?</h2>
<p>Wins come in all shapes and sizes–maybe you finally remembered to use the <code>+</code> operator in a <code>ggplot()</code> call instead of a <code>%&gt;%</code>, or maybe you’ve just published a book on teaching the tidyverse to cats. Your win should be related to something you’ve learned either by working through the R for Data Science text, or from the R4DS Online Learning Community.</p>
<p>Your win can be shared as a single sentence within the channel, or a link to a video or blog post that you’ve created. We want to hear from you and support you as you’re learning your way through <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a>!</p>
<p>Remember: the size of your win isn’t what’s important–everyone’s learning process unfolds at different rates and sizes–what matters is coming together to celebrate everyone’s learning journey within our online community.</p>
