# We're going on a learning adventure!

This summer we'd like to challenge you to participate in the "Summer of Data Science" Twitter initiative hosted by none other than [Data Science Renee](https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci)! While the Summer of Data Science (SoDS) supports all languages and endeavors related to becoming a (better) data scientist, we wanted to host a space within our [*R4DS Online Learning Community*](https://www.jessemaegan.com/post/r4ds-the-next-iteration/) for our community members to ask questions, provide support, and in general discuss what we're learning within our chosen text!

# FAQ

**Could you please explain what SoDS18 _is_?**

The Summer of Data Science is an initiative started by [Data Science Renee](https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci) that focuses on making a [commitment to learn something this summer to enhance your data science skills, and to share what you learned.](https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2017/05/29/summer-of-data-science-2017/)

**How do I sign up for the online learning community?**

You can read more about the overall community as well as sign up for our Slack group [here](https://www.jessemaegan.com/post/r4ds-the-next-iteration/). 

Please note that you __*do not*__ have to be a part of our online learning community in order to participate in #SoDS18! #SoDS18 exists as a creation of [Data Science Renee](https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSc), while our online learning community can choose to participate within our Slack channel _as well as_ on the Twitter #SoDS18 campaign.

**How do I choose a book?**

This will vary by individual preference, but if you're looking for a "just right" text, skim the first few chapters of a text. If everything looks pretty familiar, great! Now go to the last few chapters and skim. If everything looks like something you've never seen or heard before, and _definitely_ has information that you couldn't explain to someone else, then this book is probably "just right" for you.

**I joined the group but can't find the channel for my book**

You will have to add yourself to the channel. You can do this by following the instructions [here](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205239967-Browse-and-join-channels).

**I want to read a book not listed - will there be a channel for me in the Slack group?**

No, however you are still encouraged to work through a book or course and share what you've learned on Twitter by using the #SoDS18 hashtag.

**Why did you only list books? There are so many other ways to learn R and data science!**

There are hundreds, if not thousands, of resources that you can use to learn R and data science. The books were chosen in order to provide the greatest accessibility possible by removing any financial barriers, while staying firmly within the `tidyverse` approach to programming in R.

**I'm only joining this group for the SoDS event. Do I have to follow your [Code of Conduct?](https://github.com/rfordatascience/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md)**

Yes, [our Code of Conduct](https://github.com/rfordatascience/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md) is non-negotiable.

**I want to learn Python for Data Science - will there be a channel for me in the Slack group?**

No, but consider reaching out to the Python for Data Science group!
