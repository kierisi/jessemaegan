It’s February--which most people associate with Valentine’s Day, and that’s fine--but for all of us in the [R4DS Online Learning Community](https://www.jessemaegan.com/post/r4ds-the-next-iteration/), we’re going to focus on winning!  

*** 

## The challenge: share your wins
The challenge is short and sweet this month, and the same for both learners and mentors:  

1. Once a week for the month of February, post a “win” that you’ve had in our #wins channel on Slack
2. Engage with community members in the channel--emoji responses or starting a conversation by replying to someone’s win are both great ways to do this!  

*** 

## What counts as a win?

Wins come in all shapes and sizes--maybe you finally remembered to use the `+` operator in a `ggplot()` call instead of a `%>%`, or maybe you’ve just published a book on teaching the tidyverse to cats. Your win should be related to something you’ve learned either by working through the R for Data Science text, or from the R4DS Online Learning Community.  

Your win can be shared as a single sentence within the channel, or a link to a video or blog post that you’ve created. We want to hear from you and support you as you’re learning your way through [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)!    

Remember: the size of your win isn’t what’s important--everyone’s learning process unfolds at different rates and sizes--what matters is coming together to celebrate everyone’s learning journey within our online community.
