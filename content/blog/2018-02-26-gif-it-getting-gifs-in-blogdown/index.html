<p>We’re going to walk through the basics of posting GIFs on your <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a> website using <a href="https://imgur.com/">imgur</a> and <a href="https://giphy.com/">GIPHY</a>.</p>
<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Blogdown is an amazing tool for - <em>wait for it</em> - blogging. I recently made the jump to blogdown, and after working out all of my self-inflicted initial “OMG what happened <em>now</em>?!” issues, blogdown has become part of my daily workflow. I’m still playing with formatting issues (evidence below) but on the whole things are coming together nicely.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>me &amp; blogdown</strong> <em>(Why is this text so far away from the image? How do I put it closer, to serve as more of a caption? How do I move text to the top? If you know, Twitter me!)</em></p>

<h2>You said there would be GIFs</h2>
<p>If you know me, you know that I love to communicate using GIFs. So naturally one of the first things I looked into was how to use GIFs with blogdown, which resulted in finding <a href="https://blogdown-demo.rbind.io/2018/01/31/gif-animations/">this post</a>.</p>
<p><del>There’s nothing wrong with this method, but it’s a bit too technical for my needs, because really when I say GIF I’m referring to internet memes and not some amazingly useful and helpful <a href="http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a>-generated graph.</del></p>
<p><em>Edit: after writing this post, the blogdown reference post linked above was updated to include the methods outlined in this post.</em></p>
<div id="what-you-need" class="section level3">
<h3>What you need</h3>
<ul>
<li>an <a href="https://imgur.com/">imgur</a> account (see the ‘Updates’ section below to bypass imgur)</li>
<li>a GIF to share on your website - I use <a href="https://giphy.com/">GIPHY</a> for 99% of my GIFfing needs</li>
<li>blogdown up and running on your computer</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="what-to-do" class="section level3">
<h3>What to do</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Find your GIF - I’m going to use the search terms “knope dance” on GIPHY</li>
<li>Within GIPHY, click on your GIF and then click on download (I usually choose Source)</li>
<li>Go to imgur. Hover over your account name, and then select ‘Images’ from the dropdown menu, like so:
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TDYM0hl.png" /></li>
<li>Upload your GIF to imgur by whatever means floats your boat (drag and drop or using the ‘Add images’ button)</li>
<li>Click on the thumbnail of your GIF to get the following screen:
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/43iUO8W.png" /><br />
</li>
<li>Copy the link in the ‘Original GIF Link’ box - this is the URL that ends in <strong>.gif</strong>, <em>not .gifv</em></li>
<li>In blogdown we link to an image using the following:<br />
-&gt; template: <code>![]()</code><br />
-&gt; template with guide words: <code>![placeholder text](your URL goes here)</code></li>
<li>In the ‘placeholder text’ space, type in whatever text you’d like to appear under your GIF, and paste your GIF URL in between the parentheses</li>
<li>Profit!</li>
</ol>
