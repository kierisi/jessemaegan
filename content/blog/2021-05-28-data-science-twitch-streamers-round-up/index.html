<h2>Did you know?</h2>
<p>There’s an entire world of absolutely free live-streamed data science content
available to you almost 24//7 at <a href="www.twitch.tv">twitch.tv</a>?
Me neither.</p>
<p>I first learned about Twitch when it was still <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin.tv">Justin.tv</a>,
a time that feels like forever ago but also lines up with my entry into data science.
My first data science job was at an esports startup that was working hard to become a media company (we had a studio and everything!) and I spent a lot of time immersed in streams and following the journeys of different players in order to better design statistical models and infographics to tell their stories.</p>
<p>Fast forward seven years and I’m now livestreaming video games while talking about data science <a href="twitch.tv/kierisi">on my own Twitch channel</a>. Life is funny like that.</p>

<div id="the-streaming-data-science-community" class="section level2">
<h2>The streaming data science community</h2>
<p>But I’m not the only one streaming data science content on Twitch!<br />
Although Twitch has yet to create a programming or data science or machine learning category (I’m not bitter <em>cough</em> pools, hot tubs, and beaches <em>cough</em>), you can find most of us under the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Science%20%26%20Technology">Science &amp; Technology tag</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll keep updating this list, but as of right now, here are some data science streamers you should check out, follow, and engage with!</p>

<h3>mcmullarkey</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/mcmullarkey">Dr. Michael Mullarkey</a></strong> streams approximately twice a week, with one stream focused on leveling up your data science game (hang out, discuss, some live coding), and another stream called “Data Distillery Dash” where they take data they’ve never seen before, solve a prediction problem in #rstats, &amp; write a distill blog post in 2 hrs or less.</p>
