<div id="the-problem" class="section level2">
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>I’ve been working with preliminary student <a href="https://tea.texas.gov/student.assessment/staar/">State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness</a> (STAAR) data pulled from the <a href="https://txreports.emetric.net/?domain=1&amp;report=1">Data Interaction portal</a>. The data I’m interested in includes proficiency levels for every subject for every individual school, disaggregated by all available demographic splits.</p>
<p>Because downloading <em>all</em> of the data will likely require building a webcrawler, I’ve started this project by working with a small subset of 20 Elementary and Middle Schools in the Dallas Independent School District (DISD) for the 2018 school year.</p>
<p>After importing the data one of the first things I noticed was the data in the <code>Group</code> column:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SEWEVFe.png" /></p>
<p>What you’re seeing is a school name, in this case ADELFA BOTELLO CALLEJO EL, followed by 20+ rows of STAAR data split by various demographics for a given grade (we’re seeing the 3rd grade). After all of the demographic information for the <em>third</em> grade, the school will be listed again, followed by additional demographic information for the <em>fourth</em> grade. This continues for all grades for a given school before we get data for the <em>next</em> school in our list.</p>

<div id="the-thought-process" class="section level2">
<h2>The thought process</h2>
<p>My first step is always to tinker with things, and in this case I was hoping that maybe <code>spread()</code> would just magically solve the problem <em>(spoiler: it didn’t)</em>. I threw a few other ideas into R, all of which returned nothing of use, so I went to one of my personal favorites - drawing out what I had, and I what I wanted:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TOHGpXN.jpg" /></p>
<p>Drawing things out is a great exercise in creating a concrete representation of what you’re trying to accomplish by slowing you down in a way that prevents you from spiraling out of control with a bunch of garbage code thrown at your console, while also giving you space to consider the various nuances of what you’re trying to do. In this case I noticed that my school names were always in all caps, and got the sense that I was going to be doing some sort of repeated operation that was going to differentiate between a school name and a demographic. My guess was that I was going to need to use <code>purrr()</code> in some capacity, but nothing quite seemed right. So I asked for help.</p>
<p>I hate asking for help for a lot of reasons, but I always encourage others to ask for help. So in an effort to practice practicing what I preach, I spent about 30 minutes on working out a solution, come up with what I thought was an informed guess, and could articulate the problem well enough to ask for a nudge in the right direction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> <em>asking for help after 30 minutes of working on something is infinitely less painful than asking for help after 30 hours of working on something.</em></p>

<h2>The question</h2>
<p>Asking your question in a way that gets you the help that you need is an important skill. So I took to Slack with the following:</p>

<h2>The solution</h2>
<p>Ultimately - through the guidance of those who have been here before - I created an additional column by doing a <code>left_join()</code> with my data and a dataset of school names. This created a new column that had school names listed when the school name was present in the original data set, but had <code>NA</code> values for demographic splits:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nD6nqIT.png" /></p>
<p>Using the <code>fill()</code> function from the <code>tidyr()</code> package, I was able to convince R to fill in all of the <code>NA</code> values in the newly-created <code>school_name</code> column by carrying forward the school name until a change was encountered:</p>
<pre><code>library(tidyr)

# generally speaking:
dataset %&gt;% 
  fill(column_to_be_filled)

# what I used in this specific case
sample_cref %&gt;% 
  fill(school_name)</code></pre>
<p>This ultimately resulted in a much happier (although not yet tidy) data set:</p>

<h2>Where you come in!</h2>
<p>I’ve set <a href="https://github.com/jmostipak/til_locf_blogpost">this example up in a GitHub repository</a>, and I want to invite and encourage anyone who is interested in leveling up their GitHub and/or wrangling skills to build out this repo. There’s nothing in here that you can break, destroy, or modify in a way that makes it unusable - in fact I’d encourage you to use this as a low-stakes repo to contribute to!</p>
<p>If you’re not sure where to start, consider updating the README, approach this problem a different way, continue tidying up the code, or even do a full-blown analysis! Whatever you choose, I’m happy to support good-faith contributions and help you out as you develop your open source contributing skills.</p>
