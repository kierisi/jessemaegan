<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>April is such a fantastic time of the year - the weather starts to warm up, trees and flowers start blooming, and many of us start in on some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_cleaning">spring cleaning</a>. So it’s only natural that we’d focus on the same thing in our <a href="https://www.jessemaegan.com/post/r4ds-the-next-iteration/">R4DS Online Learning Community</a>!</p>

<h2>Finishing up March’s Viewing Parties</h2>
<p>Thank you to everyone who participated in our viewing party in early March, where member <a href="https://twitter.com/kcat_km">Chris B.</a> shared with us how to use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O04l-LpmoE8">RMarkdown and Shiny with students</a>!</p>
<p>While there’s been a bit of a lull, community member <a href="https://twitter.com/JonTheGeek">Jon H.</a> will be closing out the month of March with a talk about package development on March 31st. You’re going to want to make sure you catch this one!</p>
<p>Due to some scheduling conflicts, some of our talks have been moved to April - we’re excited to announce the following tentative schedule, and can’t wait to see <strong>you</strong> at the viewing parties!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/unsorsodicorda">Andrea</a>: Saturday, April 7th</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/renatagerecke">Renata</a>: second week of April</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/raviolli77">Raul</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/thomas_mock">Thomas</a> (two separate talks!): third week of April<br />
</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/kierisi">Jesse</a>: fourth week of April</li>
</ul>

<h2>April’s “Tidy” challenges!</h2>
<p>Our April challenges are unique and extra awesome because they’ve been developed <em>entirely</em> by R4DS community members - which is truly about as awesome as it can get!</p>
<p>I’m going to be a bit cryptic and let you know that this first challenge is going to give you the opportunity to make <code>dplyr</code> your new BFF as you tidy your heart out - but that’s all I’m going to divulge for now!</p>
<p>Our second project is <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md">#TidyTuesday</a>, where every Monday we’ll post a tame (but not necessarily tidy!) dataset, an original chart associated with that dataset, and ask you to apply your take on the chart.</p>
<p>The goal of <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md">#TidyTuesday</a> is to apply the skills you’re picking up from the <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/"><strong>R for Data Science</strong></a> text to tidy and plot data, and then explore other’s work and connect with the greater <code>#rstats</code> community on Twitter by using the <code>#TidyTuesday</code> hashtag!</p>
<p><em>If <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md">#TidyTuesday</a> sounds familiar, that’s because it’s inspired by the awesome <a href="http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/">#MondayMakeover</a> series from Tableau.</em></p>
<p>Both of these projects are the result of collaborations between Radovan, Burcu, Raul, Rosa, Jake, Thomas, &amp; Ariel, and we’re thrilled to be sharing them with our community!</p>
