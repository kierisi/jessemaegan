<h2>Happy New Year!</h2>
<p>I love the start of the New Year for so many reasons, but one of my favorites is the never-ending stream of motivational word art that populates a good 98% of every social media feed for 31 whole days, like so:</p>

<p>Another reason for loving the start of 2018 is that we’re kicking off the next iteration of the <a href="https://www.jessemaegan.com/post/r4ds-the-next-iteration/">R for Data Science Online Learning Community</a>! So if you’re joining us for January, consider participating in the January Challenge.</p>
